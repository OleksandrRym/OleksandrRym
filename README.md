# Hi there! 👋

This is my personal hub of projects, ideas, experiments, and just some "junk" that might come in handy one day 😄  
I mostly write in Java, play around with microservices, Kafka, databases, a bit of DevOps, a bit of automation — anything that sparks interest.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

- Java developer (on my way to mid-level)
- Computer Science student
- I enjoy tackling challenges, debugging weird stuff, and making sense of chaos
